			<p>A DOS-like operating system for the x86 CPU architecture. Has support for multiple IDE drives (IDE primary master is always the boot/system drive). Input is recieved from a PS/2 keyboard and output is given through 16-color 80x25 character VGA. A series of programs come with the operating system, they can also be loaded onto the virtual drive by the automake macro if you desire to run SystemZero inside a virtual machine.</p>

			<h2>Main features of SystemZero:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>80x25 character 16-color VGA display</strong> with support for color changing via the <strong>color</strong> command. TTY speed varies with computer so the keyboard character printing speed gets auto-calibrated at boot.</li>
				<li>PS/2 keyboard support with advanced features like shifting characters during erasing or inserting text where text already exists in front.</li>
				<li>Single processing with subprocess support (requires manual memory allocation but that gives the programmer a greater degree of power over how programs behave). <strong>All processes run in ring-0 or kernel mode.</strong></li>
				<li>Filesystem also built from scratch (named ESFS or Even Simpler Filesystem). The <strong>maximum filesize is 896kb</strong>. No support for directories.</li>
				<li><strong>Support for multiple IDE drives in ATA PIO mode</strong>. Commands are automatically ran from the system drive so that it it possible to switch drives in case a <strong>drive</strong> command is not present on the selected drive.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Basic usage of built-in shell utilities:</h2>
			<p><strong>append</strong> - (append text data to a file) Syntax: append [-n (optional: adds a newline character at end of appended text)] file.ext text text text text...</p>
			<p><strong>cls</strong> - (clear the screen) Syntax: cls</p>
			<p><strong>color</strong> - (set the text console color scheme) Syntax: color [0 - 15 (bg)] [0 - 15 (fg)]</p>
			<p><strong>del</strong> - (delete a file) Syntax: del file.ext</p>
			<p><strong>drive</strong> - (select a drive) Syntax: drive [0 - 3 (drive code)]</p>
			<p><strong>drives</strong> - (list avaliable drives) Syntax: drives</p>
			<p><strong>format</strong> - (format selected drive) Syntax: format</p>
			<p><strong>list</strong> - (list files on selected drive) Syntax: list</p>
			<p><strong>read</strong> - (dump text data from file onto console) Syntax: read file.ext [0 - ... (optional: read 512 byte chunk at given index)]</p>
			<p><strong>touch</strong> - (create a file) Syntax: touch file.ext</p>
			<p><strong>view</strong> - (view a file with the ability to scroll forward and back) Syntax: view file.ext</p>
